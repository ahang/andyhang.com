### About the Project
The APP (Almost Perfect Pick) aka Project Ares was the first group project that I contributed to. You can view the page live [here](/project_ares/) and you can also view the code [here](https://github.com/ahang/project_ares). The group consisted of [Liam Fox](https://github.com/FoxMessenger), [Shreya Kondilya](https://github.com/skondilya), [Louise Nyambati](https://github.com/LouiseNyambati) and myself. 

### Project Mission
The purpose of the application is to alleviate the woes of browsing movies through Netflix. We all have been in this situation where we are constantlly browsing through what movies trying to find out what to watch and it takes up the majority of our time! The motto is "More movies and less search time". 

### Project Management
We utilized both Slack for communication and Trello to break down each of the task. This was our first time using Trello for project management. Check out our board [here](https://trello.com/b/nOCHnioy/tasks-for-proj-ares). I broke down the majority of tasks into sizeable portions and attempted to scope properly as we only had two weeks to complete the project. The stuff that were difficult to implement due to our lack of experience could be a v1.1 release. Things that we can easily break down and implement correctly will be labeled as v1.0!
