Thanks for stopping by. I plan on blogging my weekly progress through the Northwestern Web Development Boot Camp! It has been a rush. I started on January 23rd and I am on week 9 of the camp. I have completed 6 homeworks and 1 group project, which btw I am super proud of (ALTHOUGH!!! it could be better). One of my group mate and I plan on going through the project and making it better. One of the memorable homeworks I've completed was a Javascript RPG. Check it out live [here](/week-4-game/index.html) or the code [here](https://github.com/ahang/week-4-game). It was a struggle to work out how to pseudocode and how to properly utilize javascript, but once I've started understanding it more. It was awesome to see it being completed!

Anyhow, expect a blog on the Project I've completed in the next couple weeks and progress on the course. I am currently learning node and the difficulty has once again resurface! Everyday is a learning progress, which I thoroughly enjoy.
