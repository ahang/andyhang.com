### Putting It All Together!
When the pieces of the project came together, it was a big ordeal to me at least. We had integrated the app that does the AJAX calls to the two APIs that we used. We had integrated user login and we successfully tracked whether the user was login or not through using Firebase. The whole experience of developing a project from nothing was a great experience. We had only two weeks to complete the project! Not only was this a great experience, I learned that I can project manage well to a certain degree. I learned that what seemed like a formidable task at first is easily over comeable with lots of task being broken down to smaller pieces and of course with plenty of psuedocode!

If I had to start this project all over, I would break the task down to even smaller tasks within itself. Mainly because some of the "bigger" tasks that was written, could be split up even smaller. I would also spend less time on forcing the user auth to work when I was struggling on it for a couple days. That time could be used getting more of the 1.0 release that we had planned. Surprisingly, it didn't set the project back not one bit as we got all the features we wanted into the app by due date. 

My views moving forward is to always be learning something new. I am preparing myself to tackle the next Project which should be exciting.
