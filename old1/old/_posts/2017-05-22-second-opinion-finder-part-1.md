### About the Project
Second Opinion Finder is the second group project that I collaborated in while at NU Coding Bootcamp. You can view the page live [here](http://secondopinionfinder.herokuapp.com) and you can also view the code [here](https://github.com/ahang/secondOpinion). The team consists of [Caryn Carter](https://github.com/Caryndcarter), [Laura McGinn](https://github.com/LauraMcG), [Jared Moscrip](https://github.com/1jared123), and [Paul Sulikowski](https://github.com/psulikow)

### Project Mission
The purpose of this application is to assist patients who are seeking additional medical advice, from a different doctor that is not related to their current doctor, on a sudden diagnosis and have been given a risky or intense treatment recommendations. This application could alleviate some concerns that the referred medical doctor will have no connections to their current doctor to get a second opinion that is completely unbiased. 

### Project Management
We utilized both Slack for communication and Github Projects to break down each of the task. You can view all of the tasks/feature [here](https://github.com/ahang/secondOpinion/projects/1). Breaking each feature into manageable sizes helped in pushing out a completed project within 2 weeks. This is extremely helpful for us especially in a team of 5. Each person was able to grab a feature and work to implementing it and building the application as a whole.
