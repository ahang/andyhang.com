Hello! I am currently a student at Northwestern Coding Bootcamp, learning how to become a Web Developer. Over the last seven weeks, I have learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and Firebase (a NoSQL database). Over the next two months, we will cover Node, ReactJS, and a few other technologies. I also work full time as a quality assurance engineer for a bankruptcy software company. I am a very detailed-oriented person and a problem solver who is looking to switch careers and focus fully on development!
